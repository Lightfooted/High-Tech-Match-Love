# High-Tech-Match-Love

11/12/2021 - Brenda

Initial code created with the Module 22 starter code.

After installing the starter code, I ran npm install in the root directory. I did not run the seed command since that would install the Mod22 stuf (shop-shop app). I then ran npm run develop from the root directory, and it works, althouhg, of course, the shop is empty since I didn't run the seed.

From 22.1.3: Note that the starter code includes a service worker. The service worker inclusion is no longer the default behavior for the most recent version of the create-react-app utility. When using this utility in the future to make an app from scratch, remember that some additional arguments are required to add a service worker to your app. For more information, refer to the Create React App documentation on creating a PWA (Links to an external site.).

22.4.4 and 22.4.5 install Stripe (a payment package). I'm not installing that yet since we don't know yet if we'll need that.
